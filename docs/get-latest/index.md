**Not sure if you have an Intel/AMD x64 processor or an Arm64 processor?** From your Start menu, choose the Settings app. Then click on System, and scroll down to About. Under "Device specifications" you will see "System type". That will say something like "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor" or "64-bit operating system, Arm64-based processor" or similar. That tells you which version to download.

## System Requirements

> NOTE: During development, the only supported version of Windows is **Windows 11 Insider Canary** releases.

The **Windows MIDI Services runtime and tools** requires Windows 11 with the Windows MIDI Service, plugins, and USB driver pre-installed from Microsoft.

The **Windows MIDI Services preview service and plugins** for developers requires Windows 11 with Developer Mode switched on in the Windows Settings app. For use with MIDI 2.0 devices, the service and plugins must be installed on a version of Windows which already has the MIDI 2.0 driver and USB stack enhancements in-place. 

Any preview transport plugins, such as the Network MIDI 2.0 Service plugin, require an existing working Windows MIDI Services installation, as well as Developer Mode switched on in the Windows Settings app.
